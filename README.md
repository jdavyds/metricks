# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Installation and Setup Instructions

Clone down this repository. You will need node and npm installed globally on your machine.

In the project directory, you can run:

## Installation:

npm install

## To Run Test Suite:

npm test

## To Start Server:

npm start

## To Visit App:

http://localhost:3000

## Dependencies

I started this process by using the create-react-app boilerplate, then adding 
    react-router-dom
    
    font-awesome 
    
    Material-UI
    
    Axios
    
    React Countdown 
 as needed dependencies, these are automatically installed when  you run `npm install`
## Improvements

I suggest a more consistent design template can be adopted for all pages.
